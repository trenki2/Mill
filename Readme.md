# Nine Men's Morris Board Game

This is a small project that implements the Nine Men's Morris board game 
in Unity using C#.

For the AI a minimax search tree with alpha beta pruning is used. The search
tree uses very simple heuristic (number of stones left for each player). This
simple heuristic was enough to make a reasonably strong opponent.
